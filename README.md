# 💤 Sleep Disorder Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sleep disorders using health and lifestyle data. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, occupation, BMI category, stress level, daily steps, and more. Machine learning models are applied to predict whether a person is suffering from a sleep disorder.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is:
**`Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`**

### 🔑 Key Features:
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Occupation`
- `Sleep Duration`
- `Quality of Sleep`
- `Physical Activity Level`
- `Stress Level`
- `BMI Category`
- `Heart Rate`
- `Daily Steps`
- `Blood Pressure` (split into systolic and diastolic)
- `Sleep Disorder` (Target)

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Visualize important health and lifestyle factors.
- Identify patterns and correlations related to sleep disorders.
- Apply machine learning models to predict sleep disorders.
